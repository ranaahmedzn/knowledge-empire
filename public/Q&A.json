      "question": "What is the difference between props and state?",
      "answer": "Props and state are two most important concepts in React. We can pass the data between the components using Props and State. Props are used to pass data from parent to child components and it works like a function parameter. State is used to store data that can change any time. The main difference between props and state is that props are read-only and passed down from a parent component, while state is mutable and managed by the component itself."

      "question": "How does useState work?",
      "answer": "The useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. The useState hook is a special function that takes the initial state as an argument and returns an array of two entries. The first entry is the initial value which we give when declaring useState() and the second array of entry is the function that sts the state variable. UseState abbreviate only singular value from the state, for multiple state need to have useState calls."

      "question": "What is the purpose of useEffect other than fetching data?",
      "answer": "The most common use case for useEffect hook is fetching data from APIs. But there has a wide range of tasks beyond fetching data from APIs where useEffect can be used. Below are some example of using useEffect: 1) Managing timers and intervals 2) Updating the document title 3) Subscribing to events. Therefore, useEffect lets us express different kinds of side effects after a component renders."

      "question": "How does react work?",
      "answer": "React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. To make React faster, React developers implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript. So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to update the browserâ€™s DOM. React is a component-based library that uses a virtual DOM and a declarative programming model to efficiently update the UI. It provides a powerful and flexible set of tools for building complex, interactive web applications."
